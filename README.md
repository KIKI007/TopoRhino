# SampleNativeLibrary
RhinoCommon cross-platform native library sample

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to create a RhinoCommon plug-in that utilizes functions from a native C++ library.

## Building Sample

### Windows

To build the sample on Windows, you are going to need:

* Rhino 6 for Windows (WIP, http://discourse.mcneel.com/)
* Microsoft Visual C# 2013
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2013

To build both the Rhino plug-in and the native library, load the **SampleNativeLibrary.sln** solution in Visual Studio 2013. Then, click **Build -> Build Solution**. Note, you might want to unload the **SampleRhino.Mac** project before building. You can do this by right-clicking on the project and clicking **Unload project**.

### Mac

To build the sample on OS X, you are going to need:

* Rhino 5 for Mac (5.1 or later)
* Xamarin Studio 5.9 (or later)
* Apple Xcode 6.4 (or later) and command-line tools.

On OS X, building the .NET plug-in and the native library are technically separate processes.  For convenience purposes, this sample includes a **build_native.py** called from a Custom Command in the SampleRhino.Mac csproj.  This build script does the building of the native library automatically before the .NET plug-in is built.

#### Step-by-Step

1. Open the **SampleNativeLibrary.sln** solution in Xamarin Studio.
1. Unload both the **SampleLibrary** and **SampleRhino.Win** projects before building. You can do this by right-clicking on each project and clicking **Unload**.
1. Click **Build** > **Build All**.

#### Behind The Scenes

The **SampleRhino.Mac** contains a number of Custom Commands that perform necessary steps to properly build and use the native library.  (You can find these Custom Commands by double-clicking the **SampleRhino.Mac** project in the Solution Explorer in Xamarin Studio and navigating to **Build** > **Custom Commands**).  

First, **build_native.py** is called.  This step builds the **libSampleLibrary.dylib** using the xcodebuild command line tools.  The same result can be achieved by building the **SampleLibrary.xcodeproj** in Xcode.  

Second, a crucial file called **SampleRhino.dll.config** is copied into the plug-in folder.  This config file tells the .NET dll where to look for the dylib.  For more information on the config file, see the [Mono: Interop with Native Libraries](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/pinvoke/) guide.  

Third, and finally, the **libSimpleLibrary.dylib** is copied into the plug-in build folder after the build has finished.
